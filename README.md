**Snake Game - My First Java Project**

Welcome to my Snake Game, my very first Java project! This simple and classic game was developed as part of my learning journey in Java programming. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Snake Game is a traditional arcade-style game where the player controls a snake on a grid. The objective is to eat as much food as possible to grow the snake while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail. The game becomes progressively challenging as the snake grows longer.

How to Play
To play the game, follow these simple steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the Java code to start the game.
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement direction.
Guide the snake to eat the food displayed on the screen.
The snake will grow longer with each food eaten.
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Installation
To run the Snake Game, you'll need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. If you don't have it already, you can download and install the latest JDK from the official Oracle website or your preferred Java distribution.

Once you have Java installed, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command on your Git Bash :

git clone https://github.com/TONKAFREAK/snakeGame.git

Compile the Java code using the following command:

javac SnakeGame.java

Run the game with the following command:

java SnakeGame

Controls
The controls for the Snake Game are simple:

Up Arrow: Move the snake upwards
Down Arrow: Move the snake downwards
Left Arrow: Move the snake to the left
Right Arrow: Move the snake to the right
Escape: Exit the game
Features
Simple and intuitive controls
The snake's speed gradually increases as it eats more food
Score tracking to keep track of your progress
The game automatically restarts when the snake collides with the walls or itself
Future Improvements
As this project marks my first attempt at Java programming, there are various areas for improvement and expansion. Some potential ideas to enhance the game could include:

Implementing different levels of difficulty to cater to players of various skill levels.
Adding sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
Implementing a high-score system to track and display the highest scores achieved by players.
Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visually appealing.
Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to all the online tutorials, documentation, and Java programming forums that provided valuable insights and assistance throughout the development of this Snake Game. Your resources have been instrumental in helping me learn and grow as a Java developer.

Enjoy the game, and feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement! Happy gaming! ðŸ˜Š
